📊 Basi Descriptive Analysis On Dataset

This repository contains a Python script that performs a comprehensive analysis of three popular datasets—Tips, Iris, and Titanic—using Pandas and Seaborn. The script loads the datasets, previews the data, highlights missing values, and calculates descriptive statistics for all numeric columns.

📌 Features

✔️ 1. Load & Preview Data

Automatically loads Tips, Iris, and Titanic datasets from Seaborn.

Displays the first 10 rows for a quick overview.

✔️ 2. Highlight Missing Values

Detects columns with missing values using isnull().sum().

Columns with missing values are clearly highlighted with a ★ symbol.

✔️ 3. Descriptive Statistics

Calculates mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for numeric columns.
